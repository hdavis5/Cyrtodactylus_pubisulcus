# Cyrtodactylus_pubisulcus
R scripts and dataset associated with "Genetically diverse yet morphologically conserved: Hidden diversity revealed among Bornean geckos (Gekkonidae: Cyrtodactylus)"
The Cyrtodactylus pubisulcus complex is comprised of at least three morphologically cryptic species. The R code is provided for the discriminant function analysis (DFA) 
and the principle component analysis (PCA). The .csv file included is the size-corrected morphometric dataset. We size-corrected by linearly regressing each measurement 
against the snout-vent-length of the individual. We then subtracted the unstandardized regression coefficient from the unadjusted data.
